      <li> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? 
        <p> The most prominent part of the experience was the pattern of lines bordering each text/image box. My eyes were also drawn to the moving image on the right. No title or prominent text.</p> 
      </li> 
    
      <li> Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. 
        <p> Clicked on the gif on the right. - did nothing. Clicked on the x in the top right of the image. - which generated a new photo. Clicked it again until that box disappeared leaving empty space. 

          Moved mouse along the slider which rounded the corders of every box. - including the x boxes
          
          Send me a letter
          
          Sandspiel - super fun and playful. Spent the rest of the time in that trying all the materials. </p>
      </li>

      <li> What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? 
        <p> I most engaged with the “Send me a letter?” part. The experience was aided by sound which replicated that of a typewriter. Making it extremely satisfying when you typed, backspaced and even returned. – all actions having a unique sound attached. It kept me engaging due to the different customisable options available for the text and eraser and undo buttons. The drawing with a pencil option also had a sound attached as did the eraser and I was shocked to see that you could erase the pre-set template of the letter too!</p>
      </li>

      <li> What was your most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?
        <p> There weren’t many reparative actions involved in interacting with this website. The most would be the back button to go back to view the artists projects or blog posts. </p>
      </li>

      <li> What is your impression of how the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
        <p> As an artist portfolio, Max Bittker’s website already serves the purpose of sharing his creative pursuits with an audience. A main goal seems to be interactivity between Bittker and his audience as he shares his socials, leaves room for letters and 

          Personal portfolio 
          
          Promote himself and his art as well as his course 
          </p>
      </li>

      <li> What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
        <p> The website offers the audience to write a letter to Bittker as well as follow his socials. The outlay of the projects shows a clear promotional goal of the webpage as it also acts as a personal portfolio to showcase his skills and past work. The blog posts however show the goal to interact and teach his audience. The posts mostly consist of guides and tutorials and how he created some of his projects, so that interested audience can learn from the experience. </p>
      </li>

      <li> What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        <p> With many of Bittker’s projects being game based, audiences can interact with the website on multiple occasions for a number of minutes, exploring the different games and nuances in them. The blog format also suggest that readers of the blog can return to the website to read updates and new posts, however due to the lack of frequency, expect to return rarely. </p>
