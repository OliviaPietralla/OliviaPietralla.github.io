   <ol>
      <li> <b> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </b>
        <p> With a noticeable lack of title or other prominent text, the most eye-catching component of Max Bittker’s homepage was the strong pattern of lines bordering each text and image box. I was also drawn to the movement made by the gif on the righthand side of the screen.</p> 
      </li> 
    
      <li> <b> Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. </b>
        <p> First, I clicked on the gif on the right, curious to see if that would do anything. When that action had no response, I clicked the ‘x’ in the top right corner of the correlating box of the gif. This action led to the generation of a new image in replacement of the initial image. I continued to click the ‘x’ until no new images were generated, leaving empty space. 
          I then turned my attention to the slider, which turned out to be dial for rounding the borders. By moving my mouse along it, I could alter the roundness of the corners of the line pattern borders surrounding the webpage which rounded the corners of the line pattern borders. I dialled it all the way to right, shaping the borders into circles. 
          Next, I clicked on <a href="https://maxbittker.com/mailto"> <i>‘Send me a letter?’</i></a>, which took me to a separate webpage with a dark mode artboard where I could draw with my mouse or type out a message to Bittker.
          I returned to the main page and clicked on <a href="https://sandspiel.club/"> <i>‘Sandspiel’</i></a> and spend the remaining two minutes exploring the game. I experimented with the different materials and elements to see what would happen when they came into contact with each other. </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </b>
        <p> I spent the most time engaging with the <i>‘Sandspiel’</i> game. Bittker describes it as a <em>“falling sand game”</em>. I spent several minutes exploring each material and how each element would interact with each other. It is a simple game but captivated my attention due to its playfulness and the ability to predict what should happen, due to my pre-existing knowledge of the characteristics of each material. It was satisfying when the elements reacted how I expected them to react. For example, fire would burn away the wood and the introduction of water would put out the fire. </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What was your most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? </b>
        <p> There weren’t many repetitive actions involved in interacting with this website. The most common action would be navigating back to the homepage or back to the list of blog posts and projects.  </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What is your impression of how the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </b>
        <p> This website is first and foremost an artist’s personal portfolio. The artist, Max Bittker uses this website to present and promote his digital projects as a body of work, with the intention to share his creative pursuits with an interested audience. It is clear that Bittker also uses the website to interact with his audience and through his transparency for how he creates his projects, he uses his website to share his knowledge and help other experimental web artists. </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal? </b>
        <p> The lack of a prominent title on the homepage, gives me the impression that Bittker’s goal with the experience is to promote his work rather than himself as an artist, proving the use for a more personal and creative portfolio. 
          His name is not stated on the homepage, and the only indication that this is Max Bittker’s work is from the title in the tab. Instead, the audience is forced to click somewhere that would direct them to something that would further promote Bittker’s work. His work being; either his creative projects or his blog and Hand Held: Creative Tools for Phones course. His blogs are often informative and follow the format of a tutorial, clearly indicating that Bittker wants to help other digital artists or beginners through his website. </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) </b>
        <p> With many of Bittker’s projects being game based, audiences can interact with the website on multiple occasions for an extended period, exploring the different games and nuances in them. The blog format also suggest that readers of the blog can return to the website to read updates and new posts, however due to the infrequent posts, expect to return very occasionally.  </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time. </b>
        <p> The homepage is seemingly random, with no clear visual hierarchy, nothing is particularly centres or designed to draw attention to suggest a place to start the interactive experience. This gives me the impression that Bittker wants the audience to take their time exploring the experience in any order and timeframe they want. The numerous projects allow the audience to move through each one and take their time viewing each one. Due to his transparency involving the creative process in his blogs, I think that Bittker expects and encourages his audience to spend time reading his posts and refer back to his informative posts to help in their own creative pursuits. 
        Bittker otherwise encourages the audience to interact with him outside of the website through his social accounts on Twitter, Github, Instagram and Goodreads. The addition of social media means that the website does not need to be interacted with as often, as other information surrounding Bittker and his projects can be sourced elsewhere. </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</b>
        <p> The <i>‘Send me a letter?’</i> interaction is a clear skeuomorph of physical letter writing. It references both typewriting and drawing with a pencil on paper through the use of distinct sounds. </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</b>
        <p> I believe that the choice to use distinct writing sounds to indicate the action of writing a letter to Bittker, is to promote a playful interaction with the experience. Most interactions involving feedback to the author or artist online is bland, without a way to express personality. This interaction feels unique even though it’s falling back on what is actually familiar. It aims on bringing the real-world elements to the digital, for a more immersive and personal experience. The typewriting sounds are very satisfying, encouraging the users to continue to write and have fun. The pen tool further allows the audience to interact with Bittker uniquely, giving them the opportunity to draw a picture or show their own handwriting. </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</b>
        <p> The use of skeuomorphic design in this instance is used to make the audience feel satisfied. The sounds in this interaction accurately replicate those of the corresponding real-world counterparts. It is comforting for the audience for the sound effects to sound how they would expect them to sound in the real-world when they type or draw on paper. This allows the interaction between audience and artist to feel more personal, expressive, and playful. </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b>	What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating? </b>
        <p> I find the ambiguity of the homepage initially frustrating. It’s hard to know what to first think of the experience with no direct way of interacting with the website. I didn’t know if I was initially meant to watch the video on the right, which turned out to be a gif of a person plugging a power board. Many things, including the images on the homepage are given no explanation or context. While the borders around the boxes were eye-catching, they weren’t completely aesthetically pleasing because each box had a different number of layers surrounding it. The boxes could also be deleted from the page, leaving behind whitespace and could not reappear unless the page was refreshed, which I found frustrating because I did not know the reason for this ability. </p>
      </li>

      <li> <b> What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</b>
        <p> A lot of Bittker’s individual projects are satisfying due to their lo-fi, and playful characteristics. In terms of the main homepage, the dial which controls the border roundness is very satisfying to play with. Users have the ability to customise the webpage, where the borders are completely square, completely round or somewhere in between. This function is further satisfying because it also effects the little ‘x’ boxes which are in the top right of each text/image box. The effect is also transversal to the other individual pages on the website, not just the homepage, where the dial is. The navigational menu bar in the top left of the projects page also shows rounded borders. This is satisfying for the audience as it allows the experience to constantly be interactive and embrace the playfulness of the website. </p>
